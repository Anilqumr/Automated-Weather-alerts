# Automated-Weather-alerts
WeatherAlert is a Python-based system that fetches real-time weather data using the Open-Meteo API and sends email alerts when critical thresholds like high temperature or heavy rainfall are exceeded. It runs automatically via Task Scheduler, making it ideal for use in agriculture, events, and construction to ensure timely weather preparedness.
